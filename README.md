# MTCNN-light
## Introduction
this repository is the implementation of MTCNN with no framework, only depend on opencv and openblas.  
"Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks", implemented with C++，no framework  
it is very easy for you to use.  
it is can be a part of your project with no framework, like caffe and mxnet.  
it is real time for VGA, and you can improve it's runtime.  

## Time Cost
The average time cost is about 68ms per frame(640,480).The result is generated by testing a camera. mini_size is 40     
cpu   i5-4590  
os    windows10   64bit

## Dependencies
opencv  2.0+  
openblas  

##ubuntu   
### opencv    
you can find many tutorials.

### openblas
It is very easy to install

**Install from source**

1 download the source code from https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS  
2 Extract it and type "cd xxx", xxx means the directory  
3 type "make"   
4 type "make install PREFIX=your_installation_directory"

**Install by apt**
```
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
```
or

```
sudo apt-cache search openblas
```
you will get the following message
```

```
Then choose a package you want to install by apt

```
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
#or
sudo apt-get install libopenblas64-dev
```

### if you don't have cmake 
apt-get install cmake

## Build

```
cd root_directory   
vim CMakeLists.txt
``` 
change   include_directories(the_directory_of_openblas_include_of_yours)  
change   link_directories(the_directory_of_openblas_lib_of_yours)  
save and exit

```
./build.sh 
```

## How to Run
```
cd products/bin

# 1. run default
./mtcnn

# 2. run customize
./mtcnn [image path]
```

## for windows    
### opencv and openblas    
There have binary packages of openblas for windows, all you needed is download it to local.   
Please be careful, if you download the 64bit, you need configure the opencv and vs project environment with 64bit rather than x86
